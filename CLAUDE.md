## Development Notes

- Tests run using `uv` (microvenv) instead of traditional Python virtual environments
- Need to use `uv` commands to set up and activate the virtual environment before running tests
- Remember how to run conformance tests
- ALWAYS USE UV for creating and managing Python virtual environments
- Remember to use `uv run just format` for formatting
